If you would like to create a recipe that is very similar to an existing recipe, you do not need to create the new recipe. Rather, you could simply copy an existing recipe and then change the new recipe accordingly.

1.	Click on the **Recipes** icon from the ribbon bar.

	![](/assets/recipes/copying-a-recipe/recipe-icon.png)

2.	From the recipe list, click on the recipe that you would like to copy.
3.	Click on the **Copy** icon from the Recipes toolbar.

	![](/assets/recipes/copying-a-recipe/copy-toolbar.png)

	The new recipe will be created and added to the list of recipes.

4.	From the recipe list, click on the "new" recipe that was just created.
5.	Then, modify the new recipe as desired (i.e. new name, different ingredients, different density factor, etc.).
6.	Click **Save**.
