{% infoblock tip Prior to setting up an "alternate recipe" you will need to create a new recipe (Example: "primary" recipe has Whey and the "alternate" recipe does not have Whey). So the recipe without Whey would need to be created. Refer to Creating a Recipe and/or Copying a Recipe sections of this manual for more information on setting up a new recipe. %}


### Setting up an Alternate Recipe

1.  Click on the **Recipes** icon from the ribbon bar.

2.  From the recipe list, click on the recipe that you would like to setup an alternate for.

3.  Load in the **Is Active (Primary)** and **Is Active (Alternate)**columns into the recipes grid.

    For more information on adding a column to a grid, refer to the "Adding a Column to a Grid" section of this manual (which can be found under the "FeedWatch Graphic Interface" chapter).

    In the steps noted below, we will set up the following:

    The Close Up recipe **= Primary recipe**

    The Close Up 2 recipe **= Alternate recipe**

    Notice the **Is Active (Primary)**column is automatically checked for the Close Up recipe. This means that this recipe is currently assigned to be fed to at least one pen.

4.  Navigate to the **Alternate Recipes** panel.

5.  Click on the **New** icon from the Alternate Recipes toolbar.

6.  Pick the appropriate **Alternate Recipe**.

7.  Click **Save**.

### Activating an Alternate Recipe

1.  Click on the **Recipes** icon from the ribbon bar.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image129.png)

2.  From the recipe list, click on the "primary" recipe that you would like to modify the alternate for.

3.  Navigate to the **Alternate Recipes** panel.

    Notice that the "Is Active" column is currently unchecked in the Alternate Recipes panel. This means that the primary recipe is active, not the alternate.

4.  Click the **Is Active** check box in the Alternate Recipes
panel.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image167.png)

5.  Click **Save**.

    Now, the primary recipe is no longer being fed. The alternate recipe is essentially taking its place.

{% infoblock tip To verify if an alternate recipe is being fed, you can also go to the Pens tab to do so. Refer to the "Adding Feeding(s) to an Exiting Pen" section of this manual for more information. %}
