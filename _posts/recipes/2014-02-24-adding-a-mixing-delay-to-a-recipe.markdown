	Now modify the Delay to occur after the desired ingredient.

8.	-If you would like the delay timer to occur *after the last ingredient* is loaded, then make the sequence number for the Delay item the largest number in the column.

	-If you would like the delay timer to occur *after a specific ingredient* is loaded, then modify the sequence number accordingly (as shown below).

9.	Click **Save**.
