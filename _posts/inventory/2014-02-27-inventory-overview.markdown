Tracking the inventory balance of an ingredient in FeedWatch is an optional feature.  If tracking inventory balances are desired, tracking of one, some, or all ingredients can be performed.  Tracking inventory is specific for each location.  *Example*:   Corn Silage, Pile 1 inventory is tracked Corn Silage, Pile 2 inventory is not tracked
