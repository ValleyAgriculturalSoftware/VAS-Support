information.


  |   |   |
  |---|---|
  | **Ingredient Name** | Name of the ingredient as desired (50 character limit). |
  | **Short Name**  | Uses the first 12 characters from the "Name" field. |
  | **Type** | Type or category of ingredient. Adding or changing ingredient types are made in the FeedWatch Setup. |
  | **Description** | Allows ingredient details to be entered (optional). |
  | **Allow Weighback** | Checked = Permits ingredient to be picked up as a Weighback/Cleanup ingredient from a pen. |
  | **Allow Manual Load**  | Checked = Permits ingredient to be fed directly to a pen or multiple pens as a batch load. |
  | **Load Tolerance** | Establishes a range for permissible "loading error shortage." *Example*: **Load Tolerance** is set to 20 lbs. for Corn Silage. If 1,000 lbs. is the target amount of Corn Silage for the load, when 980 lbs. is loaded and weight settles, the system will then advance to the next ingredient in the recipe. |
  | **Reference** | Enters "book value" ingredient chemistries (i.e. nutrient values). These values are used for informational purposes and will not influence the amount of type of feed being fed to a pen. |
  | **Made by Recipe** | If the ingredient is made on the dairy via a premix, the *Made by Recipe* setting will establish what recipe (i.e. premix) will create the ingredient. if the ingredient is not created via a premix, than simple leave this option blank. | 

  *Items noted in pink are required.

6. Enter the necessary information in the Locations panel.

  |   |   |
  |---|---|
  | **Location** | Every ingredient will need at least one "location" indetified. Adding or changing ingredient Locations are made in the FeedWatch Setup. |
  | **DM %** | This is where you would enter the tested ingredient DM %. This DM % field is what FeedWatch uses to create the AF figures in the system (i.e. "working" or "active" DM %). |
  | **Inventory DM %** | This is the baseline DM % of the ingredient (at the location specified). The Inventory DM % takes into account the entire inventory of the ingredient. FeedWatch uses the Inventory DM % when calculating inventory DM quantities. |
  | **Tracking Enabled** | Refer to "Inventory Management" section. |
  | **Tracking Start Date** | Refer to "Inventory Management" section. |
  | **Tracking Start Time** | Refer to "Inventory Management" section. |
  | **Base Costs** | Base cost is used if you are not tracking the inventory of the ingredient or if the balance of the ingredient is 0 or negative. Cost can be entered as AF Cost/Ton, AF Cost/Lb, DM Cost/Ton or DM Cost/Lb. |


  *Items noted in pink are required.

  {% infoblock danger DM % and Inventory DM % are NOT the same. Use caution to ensure you are viewing and/or modifying the correct percentage when working with DM% of an ingredient. %}

  {% infoblock info You only need to enter the cost once (i.e. If you enter the cost in AF, FeedWatch will calculate the DM Cost for you). %}



7. Navigate to the **Chemistries** panel. 

8. Enter the custom chemistry values for the ingredient. Or if you entered a "Reference" option from the previous step you will notice values are entered under the Chemistries panel automatically.

  *Items noted in blue are optional.
