If you would like to create an ingredient that is very similar to an existing ingredient, you do not need to create the new ingredient. Rather, you could simply copy an existing ingredient and then change the new ingredient accordingly.

1.  Click on the **Ingredients** icon from the ribbon bar.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image103.png)

2.  From the ingredient list, click on the ingredient that you would like to copy.

3.  Click on the **Copy** icon from the Ingredients toolbar.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image121.png)

    The new ingredient will be created and added to the list of ingredients.

4.  From the ingredient list, click on the "new" ingredient that was just created.

5.  Then, modify the new ingredient as desired (i.e. new name, different cost, different load tolerance, etc.).

6.  Click **Save**.
