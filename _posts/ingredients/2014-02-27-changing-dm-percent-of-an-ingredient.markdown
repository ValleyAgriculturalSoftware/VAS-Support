    {% infoblock warning Changing the DM % of the ingredient will automatically modify the amount of AF lbs. being fed of that ingredient. %}


4.  Click **Save**.



"All Ingredients" Tab
---------------------

If you would like to make modifications to several ingredients (i.e.
update DM %, change cost, etc.) the Ingredients tab can be used to do
so. However, a quicker way to make these modifications would be to use
the **All Ingredients** tab. This tab doesnâ€™t use additional panels of
information like the Ingredients tab does. Rather, the All Ingredients
tab combines the information into one large grid all available directly
from the tab.

9.  Click on the **All Ingredients** icon from the ribbon bar.
