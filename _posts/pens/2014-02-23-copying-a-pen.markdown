If you would like to create a pen that is very similar to an existing pen, you do not need to create the new pen. Rather, you could simply copy an existing pen and then change the new pen accordingly.

1.  Click on the **Pens** icon from the ribbon bar.

2.  From the pens list, click on the pen that you would like to copy.

3.  Click on the **Copy** icon from the Pens toolbar.

    The new pen will be created and added to the list of pens.

4.  From the pen list, click on the "new" pen that was just created.

5.  Then, modify the new pen as desired (i.e. new name, different description, different feedings, etc.).

6.  Click **Save**.
