{% infoblock note In FeedWatch Versions 7.5 and 7.6 "Override Feedings" were setup as "Max/Balance" feedings. %}


1.  Click on the **Pens** icon from the ribbon bar.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image172.png)

2.  Click on the pen that you would like to modify.

3.  Navigate to the **Feedings** panel.

4.  In the **Override AF Qty** column, type in the exact amount of feed you want to feed (for this feeding only).

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image191.jpg)

5.  Click **Save**.

    A second feeding in this period will automatically be created. This is a "balance" feeding. The balance feeding will consume ALL the remaining targeted feed for this period.

    *In this example:*

    **Override/Max feeding**

    * 21.76 lbs. DM/HD will be fed

    * 5,000 lbs. AF feed will be fed

    * This feeding amount will not change day to day (assuming the pen is targeted at least 21.76 lbs DM in this period)

    **Balance feeding**

    * 8.24 lbs. DM/HD will be fed

    * 1,892 lbs. AF feed will be fed

    * This feeding amount may change day to day (depending on pen count, recipe makeup, ingredient DM %, etc.)
